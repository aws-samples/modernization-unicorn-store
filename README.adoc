== Prerequisites

To get started you will need:

- https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] installed on your local machine.
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose]
- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download[.NET Core 3]
- An IDE for building .NET Core applications such as https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/[Visual Studio]

Once you have the prerequisites installed on your local development machine you should be able to run the Unicorn Store locally either in your IDE or in a local container. The Unicorn Store uses https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx[SQL Server] for the backend by default and is seeded with data on startup. You will need to either provision or have access to a database. The below workshops like link:content/secrets/_index.md[Securing Your .NET Container Secrets] handle this for you via https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[CloudFromation].
